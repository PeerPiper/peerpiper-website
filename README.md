# PeerPiper.io Website (hosted on Cloudflare Pages)

The PeerPiper.io Website.

Built with Svelte. Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

## Contributing

Feel free to join the community by opening issues or pull requests on Github!

The guide is written in markdown, so non-technical people can easily read and edit too. It's saved at:

```
./src/routes/guide.svx
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
